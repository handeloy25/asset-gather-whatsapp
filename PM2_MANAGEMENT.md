# PM2 Service Management Guide

Your WhatsApp to Google Drive services are now running with PM2, which means they will continue running even after you close the terminal!

Both services are running:

1. **whatsapp-gdrive** - Your webhook server (port 3000)
2. **ngrok-tunnel** - Public tunnel to expose your server

**Your webhook URL:** `https://unanimating-raptly-amee.ngrok-free.dev/webhook/evolution-whatsapp-media`

## üîÑ After System Restart

On Windows, PM2 services don't auto-start on reboot. After restarting your computer:

```bash
# Resurrect all saved processes
pm2 resurrect
```

Or manually start them:

```bash
cd "D:\Projects\whatsapp asset to gdrive"
pm2 start src/server.js --name whatsapp-gdrive
pm2 start start-ngrok.js --name ngrok-tunnel
pm2 save
```

## üåê Getting Your Ngrok URL

If you need to find your current ngrok URL:

1. **Via API:**
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:4040/api/tunnels
   ```

2. **Via Web Dashboard:**
   Open: http://localhost:4040

3. **From Logs:**
   ```bash
   pm2 logs ngrok-tunnel
   ```

**Note:** The ngrok URL changes each time ngrok restarts (unless you have a paid account with a static domain).

## üõ†Ô∏è Update Your Code

If you make changes to your code:

```bash
# Restart the server to apply changes
pm2 restart whatsapp-gdrive

# View logs to verify
pm2 logs whatsapp-gdrive
```

## üîí Security Tips for Production

If deploying to a real server:

1. **Use a proper domain** instead of ngrok
2. **Add authentication** to your webhook endpoint
3. **Use HTTPS** (Let's Encrypt with Nginx/Caddy)
4. **Set up PM2 monitoring** with Keymetrics
5. **Enable log rotation:**
   ```bash
   pm2 install pm2-logrotate
   ```

## üì± Evolution API Configuration

Remember to update your Evolution API webhook URL to:
```
https://unanimating-raptly-amee.ngrok-free.dev/webhook/evolution-whatsapp-media
```

**Note:** This URL will change if you restart ngrok!
